I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at the [University of Wyoming](https://www.uwyo.edu), where I am expected to graduate in May 2027. My research focuses on [insert your research areas, e.g., environmental economics, recreational fisheries, etc.]. Specifically, I am interested in using [methodology, e.g., natural experiments, econometrics] to understand the effects of [specific research topics, e.g., climate change, noise pollution, etc.].

I received my Bachelor's degree in Business Administration (Economics and Risk Management & Insurance) from [Appalachian State University](https://www.appstate.edu), where I graduated Magna Cum Laude in December 2021.

  <summary><b>Voluntary Public Good Provision with Heterogeneous Private Benefits </b></summary>
  <p>
    With <a href="https://tlcherry.weebly.com" target="_blank">Todd L. Cherry</a>
    <br>
    Voluntary public goods provision involves individuals making decisions that consider the
    balance between heterogenous private benefits and collective societal benefits. This
    occurs in many environmental and public health contexts such as vaccination campaigns,
    adoption of renewable energy technologies, conservation programs, waste reduction and
    recycling initiatives, air quality improvement e?orts, and noise pollution reduction. The
    level of participation determines whether a critical threshold is met for achieving impactful
    societal benefits. However, individual incentives to participate are heterogenous, leading to
    potential free-riding opportunities for individuals when a population is trying to reach a
    critical threshold.
    The decision to contribute to such public goods depends not only on private costs and
    benefits but also on the structure of decision-making. Individuals may act simultaneously
    without knowing others' choices or sequentially. When individuals make decisions
    sequentially, they can observe early adopters, and this may encourage greater cooperation.
    Little is known about how heterogeneity in individual incentives interact with decision
    sequences to influence participation in voluntary public goods provision. This study
    examines these factors through a controlled lab experimental framework to better
    understand the mechanisms that drive cooperative behavior in threshold public goods
    settings.
