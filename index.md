I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at the [University of Wyoming](https://www.uwyo.edu), where I am expected to graduate in May 2028. My research focuses on using experimental methods to study topics in environmental economics, collective action problems, and individual decision making under risk.

I received my two Bachelor's degrees in Economics (B.S.B.A) and Risk Management & Insurance (B.S.B.A.) from [Appalachian State University](https://www.appstate.edu), where I graduated Magna Cum Laude in December 2021.

  <summary><b>Voluntary Public Good Provision with Heterogeneous Private Benefits </b></summary>
  <p>
    <i>Work in progress</i> with <a href="https://tlcherry.weebly.com" target="_blank">Todd L. Cherry</a> and <a href="https://www.uwyo.edu/economics/faculty-staff/david-finnoff/index.html" target="_blank">David Finnoff</a>

    <br>
    Voluntary public goods provision involves individuals making decisions that consider the
    balance between heterogenous private benefits and collective societal benefits. This
    occurs in many environmental and public health contexts such as vaccination campaigns,
    adoption of renewable energy technologies, conservation programs, waste reduction and
    recycling initiatives, air quality improvement efforts, and noise pollution reduction. The
    level of participation determines whether a critical threshold is met for achieving impactful
    societal benefits. However, individual incentives to participate are heterogenous, leading to
    potential free-riding opportunities for individuals when a population is trying to reach a
    critical threshold.
    <br>
    The decision to contribute to such public goods depends not only on private costs and
    benefits but also on the structure of decision-making. Individuals may act simultaneously
    without knowing others' choices or sequentially. When individuals make decisions
    sequentially, they can observe early adopters, and this may encourage greater cooperation.
    Little is known about how heterogeneity in individual incentives interact with decision
    sequences to influence participation in voluntary public goods provision. This study
    examines these factors through a controlled lab experimental framework to better
    understand the mechanisms that drive cooperative behavior in threshold public goods
    settings.

  <summary><b> Anthropogenic Noise: Visitor Behavior and Welfare Implications  </b></summary>
  <p>
    <i>Work in progress</i> with <a href="https://tlcherry.weebly.com" target="_blank">Todd L. Cherry</a>, <a>Caleb J. Hill</a>, and <a>Katie Tenny</a>.

    <br>
    Anthropogenic noise is an increasing issue in outdoor recreation, particularly at national parks. 
    Studies show that noise in national parks is a growing problem (Buxton et al. 2017; Chrobak 2017; Buxton et al. 2019), particularly in transportation corridors that have noise levels many times the natural level (Mennitt et al. 2014). Noise can have negative impacts on wildlife, including masking sounds that provide important signals of threats and mating. Shannon et al. (2016) documents how noise affects wildlife behavior, physiology, and fitness. Noise also impacts people. Basner et al. (2014) reports that noise not only annoys people but also contributes to health problems. In parks, even low levels of noise can diminish the benefits that people receive from experiencing nature and natural sounds (e.g., relaxation, mood, stress, etc.).  
    <br>
    To learn more about noise in national parks, the NPS also has monitored the frequency and levels of noise across hundreds of sites for nearly three decades. In 2000, the NPS Resource Stewardship and Science Directorate established The Natural Sounds Program, which seeks to 
    “…protect, maintain, or restore acoustical environments throughout the National Park System.”  These efforts have contributed to our understanding of anthropogenic noise in national parks.  
    <br>
    The proposed study contributes to this knowledge by studying the individual behavioral responses to anthropogenic noise and estimating the welfare impacts on visitors. We will employ methods to estimate recreational demand models that allow the estimation of welfare effects from noise in GTNP. This includes investigating the averting behavior that visitors make to mitigate the welfare loss. Previous work has considered the impact of noise on wildlife (Barber et al. 2010; Shannon et al. 2015), and to a lesser extent the impact on visitors. A particular opening in the literature is examining how anthropogenic noise impacts the behavior and benefits of visitors to national parks. This research will help fill this void.

    ​​Our research examines the interplay between individual behavior and institutions with a particular interest in environmental and natural resource policy. We blend experimental methods and environmental economics to understand how behavior is shaped by risk, inequality, choice architecture, emerging technologies, and strategic considerations.

The Teton Lab's facilities include a 40-station behavioral and economic science laboratory on the campus of the University of Wyoming. In-person and virtual experiments are support by an online subject management system. Our research also benefits from the UW-NPS Research Station located on Jackson Lake in Grand Teton National Park.
